# This is not being updated to v6
## Missiles have been added into `MEEPofFaith/progressed-materials`, which is my main v6 mod.

# Missiles Ohno Mod for Mindustry
With the new ballistic missile, you can nuke the enemies with various missile silos. (It's also my first mod) Please, if you have any suggestions for balance changes (I'm only gonna change build cost) or missiles, DM me in discord with #MEEP of Faith#7277 (Plase don't spam my DMs though).

## Factories
Adds a Ballistics Factory to create missiles to load various milos. Kinda expensive to run, so have fun with that.

Cool looking multi-crafter using younggam/multi-lib to upgrade your normal missiles.

## Silos (and version added)
#### Missile Silo (v1) - Fires basic missiles. These missiles travel slightly faster.
#### Air Mine Silo (v1) - Fires a missile that bursts into a field of air mines.
#### Anti-Air Silo (v1) - Fires much faster missiles that blast down flying enemies.
#### Splitter Silo (v1) - Fire missiles that split into multiple smaller missiles. Thrice.
#### Nuclear Silo (v1) - The destruction capable should be read from the name.
#### Incendiary Silo (v2) - Lower explosion damage radius, but sends liquid flames flying all over the place.
#### Virus Silo (v2) (Started by SolarPH) - On collision, creates a swarm of annoying bugs that deal damage.
#### EMP Silo (v2) (Started by SolarPH) - Deals no damage, but stops enemies from moving and makes them deal no damage.

## Plans
#### World Ender Silo (Will cost 11565 of all resources to build. Why 11565? Check the research cost.)
#### Impulse Silo (Minimal damage, insane knockback)
#### Nuclear Crawler (The name says its abilities... Like a crawler with a nuke on it.)
#### Scatter Missile (Launches an F ton of tiny missiles in all directions with pretty much as low of homing as possible.)
